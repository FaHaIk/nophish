# (WIP) NoPhish

A basic phishing server that enables users to replicate services like Facebook and generate a publicly accessible URL to share.

## Why another phishing tool?

I began developing NoPhish after discovering [Zphisher](https://github.com/htr-tech/zphisher), as I wanted to deepen my understanding of how such tools work and expand my knowledge in this area. This tool is intended solely for personal learning and is not meant for active use beyond private educational purposes. To ensure no improper use, the finished version will be made available here with key functionalities removed, which renders NoPhish unusable in that state.

## Disclaimer

NoPhish is designed strictly for educational purposes and should only be used in a legal and ethical manner. Any misuse of this tool, including unauthorized phishing attempts or illegal activities, is strictly prohibited. I am not responsible for any unlawful actions or consequences resulting from improper use. Always ensure you have explicit permission before testing or simulating phishing scenarios.

**Furthermore, NoPhish is currently a work in progress and not functional.**
